**The Tide Atlas**

The data-driven web application for reading and understanding the effects of tides in your area. View heat maps and tide charts showing current tides and tide predictions in many intuitive formats.

- What will your team build and what tools/programming language will your team use? :

We are building a data-driven tide forecasting web application by using machine learning (ML) techniques. The programming language will be used is React (front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces). We will also use the React libraries Material-UI and Google Charts to help visualize the data in a clean webpage. We plan to use the Tommorrow.io API for general information and actual tide data from NOAA to train our models. We will use Tensorflow to train our machine learning models.

- Challenge Statement addressed and how your product contributes.

Climate change affects every living being. Consistently rising temperatures rises the sea level and effects people's daily lives. Warming oceans affects how wildlife live. Our tide prediction web application provides fishermen with accurate predictions to help them plan their fishing trips according to the changing climate, as well as provide people with more data and information regarding our changing climate. Our Tide Prediction web application will allow fishermen, and/or suppliers to evaluate climate-related fishing risks by forecasting tide with our machine learning model that trained by many years of historical data and evaluate risks over the short and long term. This can help not just fishermen, but rising water levels also effect building development near the coast and many other extremely expensive and long term issues. Our goal for the product is to provide people with the information needed to make educated decisions on problems regarding the coastline both presently and in the future.

- Product Vision using the **Geoffrey Moore Template** in Chapter 1 of textbook.
- For oceanic product suppliers and policymakers who rely on tide information or implement policies affected by tide, The Tide Atlas Web Application is a website that provides accurate predictions of tide using machine learning. Unlike similar services that provide information on the environment, our service is aided by machine learning and presented in a clear and accessible design.
- Persona (referenced in section 3.1 in textbook)

- Kevin, age 44, is a fisherman located in Fort Myers, FL. He catches fish for local seafood restaurants. He has three children who all one day want to take over the family fishing business. Kevin realized that one of his most successful fishing spots is only accessible during high tide. He needs a user-friendly program to plan, days in advance, his fishing trips so he can easily access and leave his favorite fishing spot.

 - He is a high school graduate that grew up fishing with his dad. He spent many years perfecting his fishing strategy. A tool that can predict the tides and water level in Fort Myers Florida would increase the amount of fish he can catch, simultaneously reducing the amount of time he needs to spend waiting for tides. This would allow him to spend more time with his family and less time out on the water.

- Scenario 
- Timing fishing trips
- There is a fishing spot located 45 minutes away from the dock where Kevin stores his boat. The spot sits on top of a hole. When the tide is low the water is goes too low so Kevin's motor hits the ground at the entrance stopping him from coming in and out. However, when the tide is high, Kevin is able to boat right over the edge of the hole, and he is able to max out on the fish most days.
- However, one day Kevin doesn't time the tides right, and takes too long to max out on fish for the day. The tide is too low for Kevin to go back to the dock. This means that Kevin cannot bring is catch back. He has to wait until the tide comes up again in 6 hours. This means that by the time Kevin got back to his dock, all of the fish will rot, since he didn't bring enough ice to keep a full boats worth of fish. Not only is Kevin being negatively impacted, but also the small family restaurants that use Kevin's fishes in their menus can not offer fish on their menu that night.
- Kevin doesn't want this to happen again. He looks for a tool to help him predict tides in his area, but Kevin doesn't know how to read complicated tide charts, and how that will effect his fishing spot. Eventually, he finds our app that makes it easy for him to know what tide chart values are safe. Kevin now is able to max out his boat everyday, because he can feel safer knowing when the tides are going to be in and out. This helps him continue his family business and provide fresh local fish to tourists.
